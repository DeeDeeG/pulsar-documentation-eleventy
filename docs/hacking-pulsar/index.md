While there are many ways to customize the functionality of Pulsar, like described in [Customize Pulsar](/customize-pulsar), here we get the truly "Hack" portion of "Hyper-Hackable" for your text editor.

As we've seen a huge part of Pulsar is made up of bundled packages. If you wish to add some functionality to Pulsar, you have access to the same APIs and tools that the core features of Pulsar has.

From the [tree-view](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/tree/HEAD/packages/tree-view) to the [command-palette](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/tree/HEAD/packages/command-palette) to [find-and-replace](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/tree/HEAD/packages/find-and-replace) functionality, even the most core features of Pulsar are implemented as packages.

In this section you can learn the core knowledge and skills needed to begin hacking on Pulsar. Such as building the editor from source code, running and dev mode, and more.
