This section is all about how to start using Pulsar, such as how to install it and how to use it for basic text editing.

But before diving into the documentation, it's helpful to go over some aspects of how the documentation is written.

Throughout the documentation, we will use shortcut keybindings like:

**_LNX_**: [[Ctrl+Shift+P]] -
**_MAC_**: [[Cmd+Shift+P]] -
**_WIN_**: [[Ctrl+Shift+P]]

Which demonstrate how to run commands, or keyboard shortcuts used for different features. This style helps to show what the expected keyboard shortcut is for each platform Pulsar supports.

If you have customized your Pulsar keymap, you can always see the keybinding you have mapped in the Command Palette or the Keybindings tab in [Settings View](TODO). But more on those subjects later.
