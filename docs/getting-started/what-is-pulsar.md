There are a lot of text editors out there; why should you spend your time
learning about and using Pulsar? Editors like Sublime and TextMate offer
convenience but only limited extensibility. On the other end of the spectrum,
Emacs and Vim offer extreme flexibility, but they aren't very approachable and
can only be customized with special-purpose scripting languages.

Pulsar tries to bridge this gap, by offering a zero-compromise combination of hackability and usability: an editor that will be welcoming to an elementary school student on their first day learning to code, but also a tool they won't outgrow as they develop into seasoned hackers.

## The Neutron Star at the Center of Pulsar

Pulsar itself runs within Electron, which combines the modern technologies of the Chromium Web Engine, and NodeJS to create cross-platform Desktop Applications built out of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Where by taking advantage of the full feature set of NodeJS Pulsar can even interact with native C++ code, to be performant wherever possible.

By combining all of these wonderful technologies into a single application, means the packages that power Pulsar are able to be written with the same tools familiar to any NodeJS or Web Developer.

## The History of Pulsar

Pulsar certainly has it's fair share of history, going as far as not even always having been named Pulsar.

Back in 2015 GitHub launched a cross-platform, free, and open-source text editor titled Atom. To accomplish the hackability that was wanted for the features of Atom, the team that was then working on the Text Editor created a framework to combine the Chromium engine, and NodeJS, then titled Atom Shell.

Over time the functionality of Atom Shell would expand, eventually becoming it's own project named Electron. Which as a framework has given rise to a plethora of desktop applications, such as Bitwarden, Discord, and VS Code.

Around the same time Atom saw it's official release, Facebook developed Nuclide, and a whole host of IDE packages, helping to turn Atom into a fully featured integrated development environment.

Although, soon after Facebook's Nuclide was sunset in 2018, momentum on Atom began to slow. Eventually, resulting in Atom's sunset in 2022, following Microsoft's purchase of GitHub.

The day Atom officially sunset, was the same day the first beta release of Pulsar went public. Pulsar, forked from the Atom Community maintained Atom, grew a community and maintainers to become the editor that it is today. Carrying on the goals of Atom, as "A Community-led, Hyper-Hackable Text Editor".
