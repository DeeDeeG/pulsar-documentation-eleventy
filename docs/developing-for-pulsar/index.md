Part of what makes Pulsar great is the amazing community behind it, specifically
the community of community package authors, that create and publish packages that
extend, customize, and improve the behavior and features of Pulsar.

If you'd like to join the ranks of these honorable individuals, this section will
teach you everything you need to know to do so.

After giving the [Hacking Pulsar](/hacking-pulsar) section a read, you'll be ready
to dive right in this section to cover things such as Developing a Theme, a Grammar,
or how to publish your package.
