::: info
The default init file for Pulsar has been changed from the previous CoffeeScript `init.coffee` file used by Atom to JavaScript. You are still able to use an old `init.coffee` file â€” and even create a new one for use instead of `init.js`. Should you wish to reference the specific version of this document for CoffeeScript, you can find it in the [Atom Archive](../../../../atom-archive/hacking-atom/#the-init-file).
:::

When Pulsar finishes loading, it will evaluate `init.js` in your
<span class="platfom-linux platform-mac">`~/.pulsar`</span> <span class="platform-win">`%USERPROFILE%\.pulsar`</span>
directory, giving you a chance to run JavaScript code to make customizations.
Code in this file has full access to [Pulsar's API](https://atom.io/docs/api/latest).<!--TODO: Replace link when we have the API documented-->
If customizations become extensive, consider creating a package, which we will
cover in [Package: Word Count](#package-word-count).

You can open the `init.js` file in an editor from the
<span class="platform-linux">_Atom > Init Script_</span>
<span class="platform-mac">_File > Init Script_</span>
<span class="platform-win">_Edit > Init Script_</span>
menu.

For example, if you have the Audio Beep configuration setting enabled, you could
add the following code to your `init.js` file to have Pulsar greet you with an
audio beep every time it loads:

```js
atom.beep();
```

<!--TODO: All API links to be updated when it is documented-->

Because `init.js` provides access to Pulsar's API, you can use it to implement
useful commands without creating a new package or extending an existing one.
Here's a command which uses the [Selection API](https://atom.io/docs/api/latest/Selection)
and [Clipboard API](https://atom.io/docs/api/latest/Clipboard)
to construct a Markdown link from the selected text and the clipboard contents
as the URL:

```js
atom.commands.add("atom-text-editor", "markdown:paste-as-link", () => {
	let clipboardText, editor, selection;
	if (!(editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor())) {
		return;
	}
	selection = editor.getLastSelection();
	clipboardText = atom.clipboard.read();
	return selection.insertText(
		"[" + selection.getText() + "](" + clipboardText + ")"
	);
});
```

Now, reload Pulsar and use the [Command Palette](../../getting-started#command-palette)
to execute the new command, `Markdown: Paste As Link`, by name. And if you'd
like to trigger the command via a keyboard shortcut, you can define a
[keybinding for the command](../../using-pulsar#customizing-keybindings).
