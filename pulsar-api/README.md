# pulsar-api

This folder handles turning a JSON representation of the Pulsar API into proper HTML documentation.

* The JSON API representation is stored within the `content` directory named by the version it originated from.
* The `layouts` directory contains all of the EJS templates that are specific to this purpose.
* The `src` directory then obviously contains the JavaScript code that controls this process.
